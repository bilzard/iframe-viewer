# Iframe Viewer

A chrome extension that helps you open `iframe` page in a separate tab.

This tool automatically extracts `iframe` elements from a site and show you links to open them in a separate tab.

The original intent for usage is as a machine translation helper.
`iframe` elements are not translated by machine translation engine such as Google Translate.
This tool makes it easier to translate contents in the `iframe` elements.
